n the given example, the request "2+3" is passed through the PBFT network for consensus and then sent to the Kubernetes cluster to execute the addition operation using gRPC Add servers. Here's a more detailed description of these steps:

PBFT Client:
After the Parser identifies the operation and operands, it sends a request to the PBFT Client to perform the addition operation. The request includes the operation (addition) and the operands (2 and 3).

PBFT Network (nodes):
The PBFT Client communicates with the PBFT nodes to reach consensus on the result of the addition operation. The PBFT algorithm involves several message exchanges between nodes, including Pre-Prepare, Prepare, and Commit messages. The primary (leader) node in the PBFT network initiates the process by sending a Pre-Prepare message to all other nodes, which include the operation and operands.

The nodes then validate the request, create and share Prepare messages, and collect Prepare messages from other nodes. After a node has received Prepare messages from 2f peers (where f is the maximum number of Byzantine faults the system can tolerate), it creates and shares a Commit message. Once a node has received 2f+1 Commit messages, including its own, it considers the request committed and executes the operation.

gRPC Dispatcher:
Once consensus is reached in the PBFT network, the primary node sends the addition operation to the gRPC Dispatcher. The gRPC Dispatcher is part of the Kubernetes cluster and is responsible for forwarding the request to the appropriate Load Balancer.

Load Balancer (gRPC Add):
The gRPC Dispatcher forwards the request to the Load Balancer for gRPC Add servers, which selects one of the gRPC Add servers to execute the addition operation.

gRPC Add Server:
The selected gRPC Add server in the Kubernetes cluster performs the addition operation (2+3) and returns the result (5) to the Load Balancer.

PBFT Network (nodes):
The result (5) is sent back to the PBFT network, specifically to the primary node, which then propagates the result to the other nodes. The nodes can perform additional checks or validations to confirm the correctness of the result.

PBFT Client:
The primary node in the PBFT network sends the result (5) back to the PBFT Client, which then passes the result to the Parser.

In this process, the PBFT network is responsible for establishing consensus on the operation and its result, while the Kubernetes cluster manages the execution of the operation using the gRPC Add servers. The PBFT algorithm ensures Byzantine fault tolerance, and the Kubernetes cluster provides fault tolerance and load balancing for the gRPC servers.
